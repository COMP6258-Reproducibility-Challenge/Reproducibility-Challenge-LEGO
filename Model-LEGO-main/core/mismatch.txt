The mismatch test is designed to test a dissassembled model on several subsets of the same or similar size. 

The main edit was that the previous code required the task to be passed in as a subset. This caused numerous problems. For example, the accuracy of all dissassembled tasks was 0 because all 
single tasks were mapped to 0. Because of this, we changed the code to test on the entire dataset then calculate the accuracy only on 
specific classes.
