The mismatch test is designed to test a dissassembled model on several subsets of the same or similar size. 

The main edit was that the previous code required the task to be passed in as a subset. This caused numerous problems. For example, the accuracy of all single task dissassembled models was 0 on all tasks because all 
single tasks were mapped to 0. Because of this, we changed the code to test on the entire dataset then calculate the accuracy only on 
specific classes. 
These experiments all use models with unpruned final layers. This is so that the model has the potential to output any label.
